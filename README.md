# Log4jDetector

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/theque5t/Log4jDetector.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/theque5t/Log4jDetector)

Runnable jar that that detects if [Log4j](https://www.google.com/search?q=log4j) is in use within existing JVMs

## Disclaimer

Please read the [license](./LICENSE). This is a work in progress. Best effort was made to test the software, but it is not guaranteed to work perfectly in all contexts.

## How does it work?

1. Searches for targeted JVMs using target pattern (regex)
2. Scan each JVM matching the target pattern by:
    a. Attaching to the JVM
    b. Loading an agent into the JVM that scans for Log4j classes in use
    c. Logging what it's doing and what it's finding
    d. Detach from the JVM
3. Wait until the next scan interval
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until exited 

## Requirements

Log4jDetector requires the following to run:

- JDK 8+
- [Log4jDetectorAgent](https://github.com/theque5t/Log4jDetectorAgent#log4jdetectoragent)

### Operating System

- Linux: All releases are currently for use on Linux.
- Windows: Work In Progress. Currently not for use on Windows.

## Installation

1. Download the runnable [jar](https://github.com/theque5t/Log4jDetector/releases) to system that needs to be scanned.
```sh
wget "https://github.com/theque5t/Log4jDetector/releases/download/v1.0.0-alpha.2/Log4jDetector-v1.0.0-alpha.2.jar"
```
2. __If__ the [Log4jDetectorAgent](https://github.com/theque5t/Log4jDetectorAgent#log4jdetectoragent) jar is not already present, [download](https://github.com/theque5t/Log4jDetectorAgent/releases) it as well.
```sh
wget "https://github.com/theque5t/Log4jDetectorAgent/releases/download/v1.0.0-alpha.1/Log4jDetectorAgent-v1.0.0-alpha.1.jar"
```

## Usage

### Variables

The following __environment variables__ can be set before running the jar:

- `LOG4J_DETECTOR_AGENT_PATH`: The path to the [Log4jDetectorAgent.jar](https://github.com/theque5t/Log4jDetectorAgent#log4jdetectoragent)
    - Type: File Path
    - Required: `Yes`
    - Default: `None`
- `LOG4J_DETECTOR_LOG_PATH`: The log path for the detector to log to 
    - Type: File Path
    - Required: `No`
    - Default: `System.getProperty("user.dir")` (aka: Current user directory)
- `LOG4J_DETECTOR_JVM_TARGET_PATTERN`: The JVM target matching pattern (regex)
    - Type: Regular Expression
    - Required: `No`
    - Default: `.*` (aka: __All__ JVMs)
- `LOG4J_DETECTOR_TIMEOUT`: The amount of time (seconds) the detector should run for before exiting
    - Type: Integer
    - Required: `No`
    - Default: `None`

#### Examples

##### Scenario: Scan all JVMs

1. Set the path to the Log4jDetectorAgent.jar
```sh
export LOG4J_DETECTOR_AGENT_PATH=/path/to/Log4jDetectorAgent.jar
```
2. Run the detector
```sh
java -jar /path/to/Log4jDetector.jar
```

##### Scenario: Scan specific JVMs

1. Set the path to the Log4jDetectorAgent.jar
```sh
export LOG4J_DETECTOR_AGENT_PATH=/path/to/Log4jDetectorAgent.jar
```
2. Set environment variable `LOG4J_DETECTOR_JVM_TARGET_PATTERN` equal to target pattern
```sh
export LOG4J_DETECTOR_JVM_TARGET_PATTERN=".*MyApp.jar.*"
```
3. Run the detector
```sh
java -jar /path/to/Log4jDetector.jar
```

##### Scenario: Set specific log path

1. Set the path to the Log4jDetectorAgent.jar
```sh
export LOG4J_DETECTOR_AGENT_PATH=/path/to/Log4jDetectorAgent.jar
```
2. Set environment variable `LOG4J_DETECTOR_LOG_PATH` equal to file path to write logs in
```sh
export LOG4J_DETECTOR_LOG_PATH="/var/log"
```
3. Run the detector
```sh
java -jar /path/to/Log4jDetector.jar
```

##### Scenario: Timeout after 5 minutes

1. Set the path to the Log4jDetectorAgent.jar
```sh
export LOG4J_DETECTOR_AGENT_PATH=/path/to/Log4jDetectorAgent.jar
```
2. Set environment variable `LOG4J_DETECTOR_TIMEOUT` equal to 300 seconds (5 minutes)
```sh
export LOG4J_DETECTOR_TIMEOUT=300
```
3. Run the detector
```sh
java -jar /path/to/Log4jDetector.jar
```

### Output Format

The detector implements Log4j for it's console output and file logging.

- Log4j dependencies: See `dependencies` block in [build.gradle](./build.gradle) file
- Log4j configuration: See [log4j2.properties](./src/main/resources/log4j2.properties) file

#### Scans

Each scan is tagged with an id. The log entries associated to the scan are prefixed with the id. For example, the value `be30856f0d4148149907787f344c804f` in the log below is the scan id. This helps facilitate grouping log entries in various log aggregators (e.g. [SplunkÂ® Transaction](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchReference/Transaction))
